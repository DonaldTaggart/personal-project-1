# Personal Project 1

---

Welcome to my project! It's objective is to apply various data science practices to track and field data web scraped from the World Athletics website in order to answer various questions regarding the sport's competition at the elite level.

## Guiding Questions

---
- One of the sport's most popular mid-distance events is the 1500m which is contested at the Olympics, outdoor and indoor World Championships, and the NCAA outdoor track and field championships. The mile (roughly 1609.34m) is also a common distance, but is much more prevalent in the United States due to a handful of highly-competitive invitational meets. This leads one to wonder if there is a statistically-significant difference between the difference in personal records (mile PR minus 1500m PR) for American mid-distance runners and their foreign counterparts?
- A world record is obviously the greatest performance displayed in its respective event, but some constitute much greater outliars than others when compared to the other elite performances within said event. Many track fans have noted that women's world records tend to be greater outliars than the men's for various reasons. This raises the question of if there is a substantial enough difference between the distribution of elite peformances between men and women that they could be classified as such if provided with a certain set of statistics regarding an unlabeled distribution.
